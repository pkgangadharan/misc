Okay, so I need to figure out how to connect to MongoDB using Java with the sync driver version 5.5.1. Let me start by recalling what I know about MongoDB and Java drivers.

First, I remember that MongoDB has different drivers for various languages. For Java, there's the official MongoDB Java Driver. The user mentioned "mongo-driver-sync 5.5.1", which I think refers to the synchronous driver, as opposed to the asynchronous one (which might be a separate artifact). So, I need to use the sync driver.

I should check what dependencies are needed. In Maven, for example, the sync driver is probably in the MongoDB Java Driver repository. The main artifact ID would be something like mongodb-driver-sync. Let me confirm that. Oh right, the group ID is org.mongodb.driver and the artifact ID is mongodb-driver-sync. So the dependency would be:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
    <artifactId>mongodb-driver-sync</artifactId>
    <version>5.5.1</version>
</dependency>

Wait, but I need to make sure that version 5.5.1 is correct. Maybe there's a specific version for the sync driver. Let me think—MongoDB Java Driver versions usually have both async and sync drivers, but the sync one might be part of the same release. For example, the latest stable version as of now (assuming current date) would be 5.x, so 5.5.1 is a valid version.

Once the dependency is added, the next step is to create a connection. The MongoDB Java Driver uses a MongoClient instance, which connects to the database. But wait, in newer versions, maybe they use different classes? Let me recall.

In older versions (like before 3.x), it was called MongoClient and you'd connect using a URI. For example, "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb". Then you can get the database instance and collections.

So the steps would be:

1. Add the dependency.
2. Create a client with the connection string.
3. Access the database and collection.
4. Perform operations.

Wait, but in version 5.x, there might be some changes. Let me check. For example, the MongoClient is now part of the driver, and maybe some methods have changed. Also, the MongoDB URI format is similar to before—using mongodb:// with host, port, database name, etc.

So, here's a sample code structure:

import com.mongodb.client.MongoClient;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoClients;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;

public class MongoDBConnection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017";
        try (MongoClient client = MongoClients.create(uri)) {
            MongoDatabase database = client.getDatabase("mydb");
            // do something with the database
        }
    }
}

Wait, but in the create method, maybe there are options. Also, the try-with-resources ensures that the client is closed properly.

But wait, the MongoDB Java Driver 5.x might have some changes. Let me think about the imports and classes. The MongoClient is from com.mongodb.client.MongoClient, and MongoClients is a utility class for creating it.

Also, when creating the client, the URI can include options like authentication credentials, replica sets, etc. For example:

mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/mydb?authSource=admin

But in this case, maybe the user just wants to connect to a local instance.

So putting it all together, the code would be as above. Also, need to make sure that MongoDB is running on localhost at port 27017.

Wait, but when using the sync driver, perhaps there are some differences compared to the async one? For example, maybe the way you handle connections is similar but with different classes for asynchronous operations. But the connection setup should be the same.

Another thing: The try-with-resources block ensures that the client is closed when done. That's good practice.

So the user needs to add the dependency first, then create a MongoClient using MongoClients.create(), get the database, and proceed.

Potential issues:

- Not adding the correct dependency (maybe using the wrong artifact ID or version)
- Incorrect URI format
- MongoDB not running
- Authentication errors if the URI includes credentials

Also, maybe some imports are needed. For example, import com.mongodb.client.MongoClient; etc.

Another point: The driver might require certain Java versions. For example, MongoDB Java Driver 5.x requires Java 8 or higher. So the user should ensure their project is compatible.

So to summarize, the steps are:

1. Add the Maven dependency for mongodb-driver-sync version 5.5.1.
2. Create a MongoClient using the connection string.
3. Access the database and collections.
4. Handle exceptions and close resources properly.

Testing this code would require MongoDB running on localhost. If there's an error, checking the logs or exception messages would help diagnose issues like wrong URI, authentication problems, etc.

I think that's the general approach. Let me put it all together in a sample code snippet with explanations.

To connect to MongoDB using Java with the `mongo-driver-sync` version 5.5.1, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Add Dependency**
Ensure your project includes the correct Maven dependency for the synchronous MongoDB driver:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
    <artifactId>mongodb-driver-sync</artifactId>
    <version>5.5.1</version>
</dependency>
```

---

### **2. Establish Connection**
Use the `MongoClients.create()` method to connect to MongoDB via a URI.

```java
import com.mongodb.client.MongoClient;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoClients;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;

public class MongoDBConnection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Connection URI (example for local MongoDB)
        String uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017";

        // 2. Create MongoClient
        try (MongoClient client = MongoClients.create(uri)) {
            // 3. Access the database
            MongoDatabase database = client.getDatabase("mydb");

            // 4. Example: List all collections (optional)
            System.out.println("Connected to database: " + database.getName());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Connection failed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **3. Optional: Use Authentication**
If your MongoDB instance requires authentication, include credentials in the URI:

```java
String uri = "mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/mydb?authSource=admin";
```

---

### **4. Best Practices**
- **Close Resources:** Use `try-with-resources` to ensure the client is closed properly.
- **Error Handling:** Wrap the connection logic in a try-catch block to handle exceptions like network issues or authentication failures.
- **Java Version:** Ensure Java 8 or higher is used (MongoDB Java Driver 5.x requires Java 8+).

---

### **Example Output**
If MongoDB is running locally, the output will be:

```
Connected to database: mydb
```

---

### **Troubleshooting Tips**
- **Check MongoDB Service:** Ensure MongoDB is running on `localhost:27017`.
- **Firewall/Network:** Confirm no firewall rules block access to the port.
- **Logs:** Check MongoDB logs for connection errors (e.g., authentication failures).

This setup provides a solid foundation for interacting with MongoDB in Java using the synchronous driver.
